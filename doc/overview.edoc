== Backwater - Intercluster RPC for Erlang and Elixir ==

`backwater' allows you to call remote modules without depending on the Erlang distribution protocol.

It's targeted at scenarios where nodes in one datacenter need to call nodes
in another datacenter, over unsecure or unstable networks.

=== Usage ===

Run `make console' to bring up a shell.
We're going to expose the `string' module and call it remotely.

==== 1. Generate a secret ====

<pre lang="erlang" class="erlang">
Secret = crypto:strong_rand_bytes(32).
</pre>

==== 2. Start the server ====

<pre lang="erlang" class="erlang">
backwater:start_clear_server(Secret, [string]).
% {ok, _ServerPid}
</pre>

==== 3. Execute a remote call ====

<pre lang="erlang" class="erlang">
backwater:call({"127.0.0.1", Secret}, string, to_upper, ["hello"]).
% {ok, "HELLO"}
</pre>

=== Details ===

`backwater' is built on top of <a target="_parent" href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">cowboy</a> and
<a target="_parent" href="https://github.com/benoitc/hackney">hackney</a>.

==== Requirements ====

<ul>
<li>Erlang/OTP 22 or higher</li>
<li>rebar3</li>
</ul>

For Erlang/OTP 18 support, check the 1.1.x versions.
For Erlang/OTP 19 support, check the 2.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x or 3.2.x versions.
For Erlang/OTP 20/21 support, check the 3.4.x versions.

==== Documentation ====

Documentation is hosted on <a target="_parent" href="https://hexdocs.pm/backwater/">HexDocs</a>.

==== Authentication and integrity ====

All requests and responses are authenticated and signed using a modified
version of <a target="_parent" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-cavage-http-signatures-07.txt">HTTP signatures</a>;
nevertheless, it's <b>strongly</b> recommended to use HTTPS, as HTTP signatures offer no protection
against replay attacks - besides risking exposure of sensitive data.

==== Exceptions ====

By default, remote exceptions are returned as errors on the caller's side.
This behaviour can be tweaked using the `rethrow_remote_exceptions' flag in
`:call/5' options.

Remote stack traces are returned by default. Because they are computationally
expensive to generate, this behaviour can be can be changed using the
`return_exception_stacktraces' flag in `:start_clear_server' / `:start_tls_server'
backwater options.

==== Serialisation ====

The <a target="_parent" href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_ext_dist">external term format</a>
is used for all function arguments and return values.

Because trust is assumed unless declared otherwise (like in regular Erlang clusters),
unsafe terms are decoded by default.

For function arguments, this behaviour can be tweaked through the `decode_unsafe_terms'
setting in backwater options when running `:start_clear_server' or `:start_tls_server'.

For return values, this behaviour can be tweaked through the `decode_unsafe_terms'
setting in `:call/5' options.

==== Compression ====

By default, both serialised function arguments and serialised return values
larger than 300 bytes are subject to attempted compression using gzip.
The actual compression result is only used if it is indeed smaller than
the original payload.

For function arguments, this threshold can be tweaked through the `compression_threshold'
setting in `:call/5' options.

For return values, this threshold can be tweaked through the `compression_threshold'
setting in backwater options when running `:start_clear_server' or `:start_tls_server'.

==== Payload limits ====

By default, both serialised function arguments and serialised return values
larger than 8 MiB are rejected (independently of whether they're transmitted
in compressed form or not.)

For function arguments, this limit (in bytes) can be adjusted using the
`max_encoded_args_size' setting in backwater options when running
`:start_clear_server' or `:start_tls_server'.

For return values, this limit (in bytes) can be adjusted using
the `max_encoded_result_size' setting in `:call/5' options.

==== Timeouts and ports ====

The default listen port for HTTP is 8080; for HTTPS, it's 8443. This can be adjusted
on server using the `http' options, and on clients by specifying it in `Endpoint'.

The client enforces a default connection timeout of 8s, and a receive timeout of 5s.
Either can be adjusted using either `connect_timeout' or `recv_timeout', respectively,
in `:call/5' options.

The server enforces a default receive timeout of 5s. This can be adjusted using the
`recv_timeout' setting in backwater options, when running `:start_clear_server' or
`:start_tls_server'.

==== On using alternative HTTP clients ====

For now, the best way to achieve this is to build requests using the `backwater_request'
module and interpret responses using the `backwater_response' module.
